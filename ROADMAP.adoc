= Cladistics.jl Roadmap

== Current Status

Active development at v0.2.0. Core distance-based and parsimony-based tree building methods implemented and working.

== Completed Milestones

=== v0.1.0 - Core Algorithms ✓
* [x] Distance metrics: Hamming, p-distance, Jukes-Cantor 69, Kimura 2-parameter
* [x] UPGMA tree construction
* [x] Neighbor-Joining tree construction
* [x] Fitch algorithm for parsimony scoring
* [x] Bootstrap support calculation
* [x] Clade identification
* [x] Robinson-Foulds tree distance
* [x] Newick format export

=== v0.2.0 - Maximum Parsimony and Tree Rerooting ✓
* [x] Fix fitch_score return type bug
* [x] Fix Kimura 2-parameter operator precedence bug
* [x] Implement tree rerooting with midpoint algorithm
* [x] Implement maximum parsimony search with stepwise addition heuristic
* [x] Add comprehensive test coverage

== In Progress

=== v0.3.0 - Newick I/O
* [ ] Implement Newick parser (read trees from strings)
* [ ] Round-trip tests (parse → export → parse)
* [ ] Tree visualization examples

== Planned

=== v1.0.0 - Package Registration
* [ ] Julia General registry submission
* [ ] Full API documentation with examples
* [ ] Performance benchmarks vs. established tools (MEGA, PAUP*)
